Design README
This design uses CSS variables to set color values for the page, including pale-blue, bright-blue, very-pale-blue, desaturated-blue, and dark-blue. The font family used throughout the design is 'Red Hat Display', sans-serif.

To improve the application's user interface, several CSS adjustments have been made. The box-sizing model has been changed to a more intuitive one, and the default margin has been removed. The HTML and body elements have been given a height of 100%, allowing percentage-based heights throughout the application. To improve text rendering, an accessible line-height has been added, and -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased has been used. Media defaults have been improved with a few adjustments, including setting max-width to 100% and display to block for img, picture, video, canvas, and svg elements.

In terms of the design, the body has been given a background image, using the background-image property, and a background color of var(--Pale-blue). The container has been positioned to the middle of the page using the position, left, top, and transform properties. It has also been given a maximum width of 400px, a white background color, a border-radius of 20px, and overflow: hidden to keep content from overflowing.

The text-content has been aligned to the center, and the title has been given attributes such as font-weight, font-size, and color. The subtitle has also been given a color and margin-bottom.

The plan-box has been given a background-color of var(--Very-pale-blue), a border-radius of 12px, and display: flex, allowing it to take up the full width of the container.
